I will upload 1 week of slides from the NES course.  
When explaining them, follow these rules:

1. Always start each response with:  
    `![[All_slides_nes.pdf#page=X]]`  
    where **X = slide page number + OFFSET**.  
    For this Week, the offset is 308, meaning that i will refer to the slide in a bigger combined document, where the first slide for the week is slide 308. When referring to the slides in the week file I give you, use the offset to match page 1 = 308, page 2 = 309, etc...
    
2. After the page tag, write exactly:  
    **Week 10 Slide [slide number] – [title of the slide]**
    
3. Provide **only notes**, nothing else:
    
    - No small talk
        
    - No instructions like “say next when you’re ready”
        
    - I will always type “next” when I want you to move on.
        
4. If the slide contains **math or formulas**, format them in Obsidian-friendly Markdown, using `$$ ... $$` or `$ ... $` as appropriate.  
    If the slide **does not** show any math, don’t invent extra math.
    
5. If **two or more things are being described or compared**, even across multiple slides, include a **table** comparing them when it makes sense.
    
6. Assume my general knowledge about networked embedded systems is **low**, but I have an **exam soon where these slides are the main source**.  
    So:
    
    - Explain clearly and concretely
        
    - Connect concepts to networked embedded systems practice
        
    - Emphasize things that are likely exam-relevant
        

After I upload the slides, start on the first slide with content using this scheme. Remember to only write notes for 1 slide at a time and be detailed about it. For slides such as the first that dont have any real content, just skip it but write what you have skipped.
