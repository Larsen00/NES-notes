**Prompt for Week 12 Explanation Chat**

I will upload my **Week 12** slides from the NES course.  
When explaining them, follow these rules:

1. Always start each response with:  
    `![[All_slides_nes.pdf#page=X]]`  
    where **X = slide page number + OFFSET**.  
    For this Week, the offset is 423, meaning that the first slide is found in a big document I have on slide 423, and I need the output to refer to that using the offset from the slide numbers i give you.
    (so if the offset is N, slide 1 = page N+1, slide 2 = N+2, etc.).
    
2. After the page tag, write exactly:  
    **Week 12 Slide [slide number] – [title of the slide]**
    
3. Provide **only notes**, nothing else:
    
    - No small talk
        
    - No instructions like “say next when you’re ready”
        
    - I will always type “next” when I want you to move on.
        
4. If the slide contains **math or formulas**, format them in Obsidian-friendly Markdown, using `$$ ... $$` or `$ ... $` as appropriate.  
    If the slide **does not** show any math, don’t invent extra math.
    
5. If **two or more things are being described or compared**, even across multiple slides, include a **table** comparing them when it makes sense.
    
6. Assume my general knowledge about networked embedded systems is **low**, but I have an **exam soon where these slides are the main source**.  
    So:
    
    - Explain clearly and concretely
        
    - Connect concepts to networked embedded systems practice
        
    - Emphasize things that are likely exam-relevant
        

After I upload the slides, start on the first slide with content using this scheme.
