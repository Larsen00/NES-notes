### What the slide says
- An embedded system is **a computer inside a device** whose main purpose is *not* general computation.  
- It performs a **dedicated function** within a larger system or product.  
- Typically involves measuring and controlling **physical operations**.  
- Contrasted with **general-purpose computers** (laptops, desktops, servers).  
- Embedded systems are **everywhere** (washing machines, GPS, pacemakers, printers, etc.).

### My own understanding
- The key difference is **purpose**:  
  - Embedded = specialized, single purpose  
  - General computers = versatile, multi-purpose  
- Embedded systems often run **real-time tasks** and interact with physical sensors/actuators.

### Possible questions to think about
- Why do embedded systems need to be optimized for power, size, and reliability?  
- What makes an embedded system “embedded” vs. “just a computer”?  
- How does specialization allow cost or power savings?
